-- Fix RLS policy infinite recursion issue
-- Run this script in your Supabase SQL editor

-- Drop all existing policies that might cause recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own data" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for users" ON users;

-- Create simple, non-recursive policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create users" ON users FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own data" ON users FOR SELECT USING (
    id::text = auth.uid()::text
);
-- Allow all operations for now (can be restricted later)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for users" ON users FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Also fix customers table policies to avoid similar issues
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all customers" ON customers;

CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all customers" ON customers FOR ALL USING (true);
